      Hello and welcome.

    <p class="mb-5">
      I create software in my day job, and my hobby is creating software. But when I really want to relax, I create software.

      This area is a place to organize some of my <span class="font-bold">hobby</span> work. If you want to be all serious
      you should probably check out my professional profile on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/jeffbaumes">LinkedIn</a>
      or my <a href="https://kitware.com/">employer's website</a>. I'm not much for social media, but I do check in on
      LinkedIn from time to time and if you give me an interesting reason to connect I'll probably accept
      the invite. Professional collaborations are welcome through my employer's
      <a href="https://www.kitware.com/contact/">contact form</a>.

      I'm pretty well versed in web programming and data visualization.
      I also have a lot of experience in C++ and Python, and I've been known to dabble in other languages.
      I'm particularly interested in graphics programming, spinning up small projects in WebGL, WebGPU, and Vulkan.
      I also really like front end development, and the never-ending framework merry-go-round doesn't actually bother
      me all that much. Keeping up gives me something to do, and each framework usually introduces something new
      and interesting.

    <p class="mb-5">
      I've done a fair bit of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fQh9kkoAAAAJ">research</a>
      over the years in graph theory, visualization, and a few scattered biomedical domains.
      My biggest claim to research fame (other than having an
