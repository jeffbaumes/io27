Austin and his Minecraft friends get more than they bargained for when they are sent away to a secluded place which is supposed to be quiet and safe. Instead, they find themselves in another world to battle evil in order to save the realm from a powerful enchantment that kept the land from ever performing an essential task: mining.Share this family-friendly, virtue-filled chapter book with the Minecraft-lover in your life who would appreciate a meaningful story with less triviality, or enjoy reading it to your younger adventurers.
