I bought the domain `io27.com` simply because I like 27. The `io` is just there to get the very shortest
`27`-including domain I could find, and because I'm hoping `io` can still be cool in a domain name
even if it's before the dot.

27 is my favorite number, and I would like to document the reasons I like it. You can't stop me.

There are some uncanny linkages between 27 and 3:

* $$3^3 = 27$$
* $$30 - 3 = 27$$
* $$3\sqrt{3} = \sqrt{27}$$
* 27 hours after midnight is 3:00 AM. This may be a stretch. Maybe I've thought too much about this.

27 feels kind of prime-ish but is definitely not prime.

I'd argue that it's one of the most, or perhaps **the** most, socially random number.
A socially random number is a number you would get by asking random people "Quick, tell me a random number."
I have not experimentally validated this, and I never intend to, but I like to think it is the case.

My birthday is on the 27th of November. The year I turned 27 I completed my Ph.D., purchased a home, and became a dad.

There you go.
